# Obstacle-Avoidance

This project started with me messing around with a genetic algorithm and turned into a 2D object avoidance implementation for cars with line-of-sight binary sensors. The genetic algorithm can control the cars number and positioning of sensors as well as the feedback that sensors pass into the steering system via neural network.
